# Description

 Analyzing stock data with For loops and If statements

This script was written to run on the files "Alphabetical testing" and "Multiple_year_stock_Data"

It uses a for loop to analyze the stock data provided and create a summary table which identifies each stock's performance for the year

Another for loop analyzes the summary table to identify the stocks with the biggest % changes for the year and the most volume
